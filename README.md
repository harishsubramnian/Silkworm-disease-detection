# Sericulture Shed Automation with Disease Detection

---

## **Project Overview**

This project presents an Integrated Temperature and Humidity Management System for sericulture sheds using Reinforcement Learning and CNN-based image processing for early disease detection. It automates environmental regulation using sensors and actuators, improving silk yield, reducing manual effort, and enabling real-time remote monitoring.

> **Note:** Dataset is not uploaded here due to GitHub’s 25MB file size limit. Please download it from [Roboflow Dataset Page](https://universe.roboflow.com/sericulturenew/silkworms/dataset/3) and update paths accordingly in the `.ipynb` files.

## **Key Features**

- **Environmental Control**: Reinforcement Learning maintains optimal temperature and humidity.
- **Federated Learning**: Learns from distributed shed environments while preserving data privacy.
- **Disease Detection**: CNN classifies silkworm images into healthy or diseased.
- **Remote Monitoring**: Node-RED dashboard & mobile app integration.
